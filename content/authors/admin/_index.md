I hold a PhD in Computer Science from the  [University of Warwick](https://www.warwick.ac.uk), awarded in 2020, where my research focused on developing neural models for stepwise text illustration. Prior to this, I earned a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Engineering from the [Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Ropar](http://www.iitrpr.ac.in) in 2015.

My academic journey includes being a part of the NLP research group at Warwick and Alan Turing Institute London, where I concentrated on semantics and the joint representation of images and text. My primary research interests lie at the intersection of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Computer Vision, with a focus on leveraging Deep Learning techniques to address multidisciplinary challenges. Additionally, I explore complementary areas such as data mining and knowledge graphs.

Beyond academia, I actively collaborate with industry partners to translate research into practical solutions. I bring hands-on experience from my previous role as a Software Development Engineer in the e-commerce sector, where I developed scalable and innovative technologies.
