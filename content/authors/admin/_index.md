I received my PhD degree from Computer Science Department at [University of Warwick](https://www.warwick.ac.uk) in 2020. My research topic centered around developing neural models for the task of stepwise text illustration. Prior to this, I received my Bachelors degree (2015) in Computer Science and Engineering from [Indian Institute of Technology Ropar](http://www.iitrpr.ac.in), India. 

I have been part of the NLP research group. My primary research interests include semantics, joint representation of images and texts. I am continuously working towards developing Machine Learning and Deep Learning based solutions for many tasks lying at the intersection of Natural Language Processing and Computer Vision. Besides my primary research-area of natural language processing, I also work on data mining and knowledge graphs. I actively do industrial collaborations and worked previously in the ecommerce sector as a Software Development Engineer.
